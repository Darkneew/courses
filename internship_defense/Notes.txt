1. Quantum field theory

    It's a change in picture 
    Instead of considering dot matter or objects, we consider fields of them 
    It's a complete change in viewpoint, more generalized 

2. Correlation functions

    They are the new equiv of scattering matrix or Hamiltonian in QM

3. OPE and algebra

    what is OPE, how do we get an equiv algebra

4. Conformal field theories

5. 2D CFTs and chirality

6. RCFTs

7. W algebras

    Def
    W algebra can be written W(2, ...)
    There is always a 2
    Removing the 1
    1.5, 2.5, etc
    We don't know which exist and which don't, above writing not unique



8. Objective

9. The Sigma model

10. Sigma model on Lie algebras

11. Conformality at two levels

12. Geometrical obstruction

13. The topological term

14. The WZW model



15. Toda field theory

16. Generalizing conditions

17. First-classness of the conditions

18. Conformality of the reduction

19. Other conditions

    Conditions for algorithm, for positive mass, for logic, for BRST

20. Good gradings

    We simplify everything in good gradings

20.1. W^k(g,x,f)



21. Good gradings

    What is a good grading? Diagram of injective surjective of ad f 

22. From shifting constant to blocks

23. From Hamiltonian term to pyramids

24. Reading a pyramid

25. Infinite W algebra
